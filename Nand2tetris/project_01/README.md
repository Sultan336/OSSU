## **ðŸ”‘ Key Digital Logic Gates**  

| **Gate/Chip** | **Function**                     | **When to Use**                            |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **NOT**       | Inverts a binary input           | Reverse a logic state                      |
| **AND**       | Outputs 1 if all inputs are 1    | When all conditions must be true           |
| **OR**        | Outputs 1 if any input is 1      | If at least one condition is enough        |
| **XOR**       | Outputs 1 if inputs differ       | Detect differences, toggle states          |
| **MUX**       | Selects input based on control   | Choose between different data sources      |
